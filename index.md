# Diana Rocio Galindo

I am specialised in design, develop, implement and integrate data sources and provide solutions using data science for decision making processes. I use tools and techniques in each stage of the projects as data engineering, analysis, management, and visualization.  Some project codes are available on repositories, but most of them cannot share due to confidentiality agreements. I have strong analytical, problem-solving, and communication skills, and I am passionate about using data to support decision-making and improve social and environmental outcomes. I am constantly learning new technologies and methods, and I enjoy to collaborate to achieve goals in diverse and dynamic teams. You can view my CV on this website for more information about my experience and qualifications. If you need references or further information, please contact me directly.

### [Applied research and innovation projects for geospatial data management](/idi_projects)

Geospatial data (vector and raster) analysis commonly implies use of conventional statistical data and its integration with alternative sources in applied research and innovation projects. Likewise, requires the application of different techniques for data analysis including statistical methods, machine Learning and AI algorithms.
